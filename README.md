# BinarySearchTree

General conditions for tasks.
Implement a binary search tree for integers. The program gets an input of a sequence of integers and builds a tree from them. Elements in trees are added according to the result of finding their place. If the element already exists in the tree, you do not need to add it. The tree is not balanced.

Input data
The program receives a sequence of natural numbers. The sequence ends with a number 0, which means the end of the input, and you do not need to add it to the tree.

Problem number 1
Output the only number - the height of the resulting tree.

Problem number 2
Output all the elements of the resulting tree in ascending order.
